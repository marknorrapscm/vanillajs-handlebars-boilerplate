# vanillajs-handlebars-boilerplate
A no-nonsense boilerplate for VanillaJS projects that uses Handlebars as a templating engine. 

## ðŸš€ Quick start

To run this locally:

1. Clone project `git clone https://github.com/marknorrapscm/vanillajs-handlebars-boilerplate.git .`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the app: `npm run start`
4. If your browser doesn't open it automatically, navigate to: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Maintenace
I will perform periodic package maintenance (i.e. every few months) so the repo doesn't end up with horrific `npm audit` results.
